				<p>
				I have been a part of <a href="https://lol.gamepedia.com/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign" style="text-decoration: none;">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's</a> for all 4 of my college career. I have taken roles as a member, an analyst, and as the team captain. We have been consistently at the top, placing at least in the top 32 amongst 500+ colleges in North America. During my senior year, my team and I were invited out to the <a href="http://www.riotgames.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">Riot Games North American League Championship Series (NALCS)</a> studio to play in the top 8 single elimination bracket for the 2018 Collegiate Championships. We placed top 4 in the event overall and was awarded $5,000 in scholarship prize money. <br/>

				<h2><b>A Fast Learner</h2></b></center><br/>
				<p>Whether it's to quench a creative itch or purely for the desire of learning something new, I often find myself picking up new things. <br /><br/><h3><b>Sony Vegas</b></h3><br/>One of my creative outlets for a long time now has been video editing. It's been something I self-taught myself, looking up questions on Google every now and then, and it is something I have enjoyed doing ever since I started playing games that have that element that traditional sports has: being a spectator sport. I realized that people might enjoy watching quick stitched up edits and so (disclaimer: I'm not a professional video editor) I picked up video editing as a hobby.<br/><br/><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-dI3u04EfQ?controls=1&showinfo=0&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
				<br/><br/>
				<h3><b>Google Suites</h3></b>
				<br/>Whenever I played games, I've always had a fascination for collecting, organizing, analyzing, and displaying data in a very simple and concise format. Obviously the end goal of it all is to be able to look at the data and understand exactly what is going on and use the information from the data to make logical decisions. My fascination for this, as well as having to organize data and write up labs for some of my upper level physics courses in university, has made me pretty good at Google/Microsoft Suites. <br /><br /><center><iframe width="760" height="515" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRdyGWgN8FTWlRsLVsq0xlZbeUkZsMp5hEHp9YCpHd05ahzlkLP97Vk2VQw6_BwQHVQp1L9Pl4pHoII/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe></center><br />
				This spreadsheet in particular is an example of something I did for UCLA <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JhCXjkjVc_eSI0DEdWSbkUBvG7x0D8XTBylKM_-9EUE/edit?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration: none;">(click here for a direct link)</a>. The reason as to why I have this spreadsheet both here and on my projects page is because I'm proud of how quickly I was able to make this (4-5 hours) while utilizing multiple functionalities of Google Suites. (Also over there I talk more about the project itself). 
				<br/><br/>
				<h3><b>Computer Programming/Web Development</h3></b><br/>
				Again, I talk more about individual projects in the projects page, but here I'd like to highlight the fact that I have picked up different coding languages (all of which are self-taught). The desire to learn stems off the fact that I wanted to create something with what I've learned. For python, it was mostly for data science and to be able to quickly organize and sift through data. Likewise, PostgreSQL was for storing said data (and honestly knowing a database management language was probably a good idea). I picked up HTML/Javascript/CSS and created basically the entirety of this website's template in about 4 hours. I'm probably going to remake this website and start from scratch and utilize new tools (and honestly, to clean up the code and make it a lot more efficient). As for what new tool, I'm eyeing you, Angular.

				<h2><b>Others</h2></b></center><br/>
				<p>
				Having been part of a competitive team for 4 years and working with others during my time in university has taught me a lot about teamwork and communication. This is especially true when it comes to working with others as being the team captain of the university's collegiate team has taught me a lot when it comes to working with others, being a leader, and the importance of a good relationship. In addition to this and all of the tedious lab reports that I had to write in order to present findings and how I approached tasks, I am also an extremely fast typer. <br/><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GfyHoFt.png"></img></center><br/>Additionally, here are two lab reports for two separate lab courses (classical physics lab [PHYS 401] & light lab [PHYS 402]).<center><br /><iframe width="850" height="800" src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSdCYhRf4VuCssjppGjD_ISz1UzryXBHpI8HQTIb21ZI7J_pXGUWhanuHHdJP-Asp2DAvExMEnWHUZ1/pub?embedded=true"></iframe><br/><br/><iframe width="850" height="800" src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS-fcPqbkZOr4Knna4E1-uGX3MHMScbt1cb2BqTuImYqLqv4rCfQwz9tK_UjRAscegz6lJDKYvuRZgL/pub?embedded=true"></iframe></center>

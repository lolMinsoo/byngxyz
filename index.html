				<p>
				I have been a part of <a href="https://lol.gamepedia.com/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's (UIUC)</a> for the entire duration of my college career (4 years). I played under the online alias "Minsoo" and I have taken roles as a member, an analyst, and as the team captain of UIUC. We have been consistently at the top, placing at least in the top 32 amongst 500+ colleges in North America. During my senior year, my team and I were invited out to the <a href="http://www.riotgames.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Riot Games North American League Championship Series (NALCS)</a> studio to play in the top 8 single elimination bracket for the 2018 Collegiate Championships. We placed top 4 in the event overall and was awarded $5,000 in scholarship prize money. <br/>

				<h2><b>A Fast Learner</h2></b></center><br/>
				<p>Whether it's to quench a creative itch or purely for the desire of learning something new, I often find myself picking up new things. <br /><br/><h3><b>Sony Vegas</b></h3><br/>One of my creative outlets for a long time now has been video editing. It's been something that is self-taught - looking up questions on Google every now and then, and it is something I have enjoyed doing ever since I started playing games that have that element that traditional sports has: being a spectator sport. I realized that people might enjoy watching quick stitched up edits and so (disclaimer: I'm not a professional video editor) I picked up video editing as a hobby.<br/><br/><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-dI3u04EfQ?controls=1&showinfo=0&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
				<br/><br/>
				<h3><b>Google Suites</h3></b>
				<br/>Whenever I played games, I've always had a fascination for collecting, organizing, analyzing, and displaying data in a very simple and concise format. Obviously the end goal of it all is to be able to look at the data and understand exactly what is going on and use the information from the data to make logical decisions. My fascination for this, as well as having to organize data and write up labs for some of my upper level physics courses in university, has made me pretty good at Google/Microsoft Suites. <br /><br /><center><iframe width="760" height="515" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRdyGWgN8FTWlRsLVsq0xlZbeUkZsMp5hEHp9YCpHd05ahzlkLP97Vk2VQw6_BwQHVQp1L9Pl4pHoII/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe></center><br />
				This spreadsheet in particular is an example of something I did for UCLA <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JhCXjkjVc_eSI0DEdWSbkUBvG7x0D8XTBylKM_-9EUE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">(click here for a direct link)</a>. The reason as to why I have this spreadsheet both here and on my projects page is because I'm proud of how quickly I was able to make this (4-5 hours) while utilizing multiple functionalities of Google Suites. (Also over there I talk more about the project itself). 
				<br/><br/>
				<h3><b>Computer Programming/Web Development</h3></b><br/>
				Again, I talk more about individual projects in the projects page, but here I'd like to highlight the fact that I have picked up different coding languages (all of which are self-taught). The desire to learn stems off the fact that I wanted to create something with what I've learned. For python, it was mostly for data science and to be able to quickly organize and sift through data. Likewise, PostgreSQL was for storing said data (and honestly knowing a database management language was probably a good idea). I picked up HTML/Javascript/CSS and created basically the entirety of this website's template in about 4 hours. I'm probably going to remake this website and start from scratch and utilize new tools (and honestly, to clean up the code and make it a lot more efficient). As for what new tool, I'm eyeing you, Angular.

				<h2><b>Others</h2></b></center><br/>
				<p>
				Having been part of a competitive team for 4 years and working with others during my time in university has taught me a lot about teamwork and communication. This is especially true when it comes to working with others as being the team captain of the university's collegiate team has taught me a lot when it comes to working with others, being a leader, and the importance of a good relationship. In addition to this and all of the tedious lab reports that I had to write in order to present findings and how I approached tasks, I am also an extremely fast typer. <br/><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GfyHoFt.png"></img></center><br/>Additionally, here are two lab reports for two separate lab courses (classical physics lab [PHYS 401] & light lab [PHYS 402]).
				<center><br/> Note that for some reason, this website isn't able to display the document itself correctly (the formatting was messed up, formulas aren't being rendered properly). You can find a properly formatted version here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fnNOaFaXRF9d9sKLuNRZNYdfcQVq8foqrAUja8uFwT0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Experiment #8 - Qualitative Studies with Microwaves & Microwave Cavities</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9UFfrFgLJMjtk0pRJKRsc-OVZ3AL6C1R7RHBgP4Fbk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Lab C-9: Fresnel's Relations</a>.</center><br/>

		<center><h2>Discrank</h2></center>
		<p>
		Discrank has been probably one of the longest and coolest projects I've worked on. Discrank is essentially a chat bot for a program called <a href="http://discord.gg/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Discord</a>. Discord is a platform for gamers and can be thought of as a combination of Slack and Skype. Discord's prominent features include VoIP, video calls, and a chat system. Discrank is being hosted for free by me on an old laptop that sits next to my computer, and it currently is servicing 320,000+ users. Discrank was at first an entry for <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/api-challenge-april2016.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">the 2016 Riot API Challenge</a> but has since been further developed as users enjoyed our project. Discrank is constantly going through updates to compensate for Riot's constantly changing API (this is due to the nature of the game that Riot hosts, <i>League of Legends</i>). Additionally, there are updates that we have pushed past the realm of what the chat bot was intended for. This includes things like a sound tag system (the bot will download short audio clips from YouTube (and other websites) and play them back as an audio clip in an audio channel), a plugin for keeping track of games being played in the charitable event <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">Games Done Quick</a>. An interesting feature that wasn't added to Discrank itself but a test version of the bot (due to the fact that this plugin wasn't going to be universally used anyways) was a "classmates" plugin. This plugin would keep track of a course at UIUC and notify a user whenever a class that they desired had opened up. Getting into certain classes (usually popular gen ed. classes or computer science classes) is extremely difficult at UIUC, and this plugin helped a lot of members at UIUC out when it came to registering for what they wanted. Additionally, Discrank has a Wolfram|Alpha integration and was also sponsored by Wolfram|Alpha for a full developer API key. If you'd like to see the project in action for yourself or just want Discrank on your Discord server, feel free to add it here: <a href="http://discrank.com" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">https://discrank.com</a>

		<h2>Data Collecting/Tracking Spreadsheets</h2>
		</center>
		<p>
		One of my favorite things to do when playing games is to collect, organize, and analyze data. Some of the spreadsheets that I have worked on utilizes multiple aspects of Google Suites and uses some of the more advanced functionality provided by Google. <br /><br />
		<center>
		<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbKvhUk3kyYYcOCNjYjVpJ-cdiRP-U91zQEgxQGlcX6-8lQtWvCCTKv_SSNfg_5mobZu2eM3IoVMsX/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false" width="760" height="515"></iframe>

		This spreadsheet was to keep track of and collect an entire guild's worth of contribution (how much money individual players brought in to the guild). The spreadsheet was for transparency to let everyone know how much value they brought in as well as be transparent about how much compensation they will receive as a result of their contribution. Basically all values are linked by a constant variable in the case of some variable changing. This is possible whenever the game developers decide to change the balance of how a certain game mechanics work, so this spreadsheet was made with all of that in mind.
		<br />

		This spreadsheet was a result of collecting professional player's data throughout the years 2014-2017. Riot's API was used to achieve this. In addition to collecting data, a simple formula was used to weigh different stats to value a player's overall worth. However, this one spreadsheet is a collective of players in different regions that sometimes rarely played against each other, so this spreadsheet is not an overall ranking but can be broken down to essentially a player's worth within their respective region. The python scripts used to collect the data can be found <a href="loldata.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">here (this was using pre-recorded match history links)</a> as well as <a href="loldata2.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">here (this was using Riot's match history links)</a>

		<br/>This UCLA spreadsheet was created in order to facilitate an organized and (hopefully) cheat-free process for those that attend UCLA to sign up for tournaments. The spreadsheet itself is flexible in the fact that with the edit of a few "variables" within the document itself, t he spreadsheet can be used for tournaments of varying team sizes (i.e. 1v1, 2v2, 5v5). Additionally, advanced options were used to try and eliminate as much cheating as possible. This included verifying that a user's UCLA email was legitimate when submitting a Google Form document using: <br/><code>@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.ucla+\.edu|@ucla+\.edu</code><br/> and then verifying that the email itself actually existed by cross checking using a simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) check. The spreadsheet itself would then calculate the average rankings (including the average ranking with substitute players) and determine whether or not the team entered was eligible based on tournament rules (restrictions were put in place to promote fair play [i.e. balanced teams]). All the teams information (player name, captain name, email, summoner name, ranking) was organized and displayed in such a way that was aesthetic. For an easier time reading the document, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JhCXjkjVc_eSI0DEdWSbkUBvG7x0D8XTBylKM_-9EUE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">click here for a direct link.</a>

		There are a few other things I'd like to get into (that had to do with large data set analysis) but the project itself was contractual and included me signing an NDA, so unfortunately I don't get to show a bit of that. :(

		<h2>This Website</h2></center><br />
		
		
		<p>
		This website is my first attempt at making a website that uses HTML/Javascript/CSS all in one. Although it's pretty simplistic, it is a product of a few hours of learning and putting stuff together. I plan on completely rewriting the website and adding new/more animations in the future. One of my favorite parts about working on this website has been utilizing javascript to make things like clicks do stuff, so I'll probably look to abuse that much more in the future. Hopefully this website isn't <i>that</i> bad for it being a few hours of a learning process. My goal was to make it rather simplistic and presentable, and I feel like it accomplishes that. If you think I can improve it in some way, feel free to <a href="mailto:byang18@illinois.edu">email me.</a>
